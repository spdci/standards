  description: |-
    The IBR(Integrated Beneficiary Registry) interoperability APIs describes different APIs some of them are usecase specific and other are generalized APIs to perform interoperable operations between IBR registry and SP-MIS.
    You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the definition itself or to the code.
    That way, with time, we can improve the API in general, and expose some of the new features in upcoming version.

    1. Search: The Search API provides functionality to search based on demographic, identifiers and custom query
    2. Enrollment updates: The enrollment updates API send  details of beneficiaries enrolled in programs  from SP-MIS system
    3. Enrolled : the enrolled API is a special type of search to return the programs a beneficiary is enrolled in

    Each request is build up of three parts 
    - signature 
    - header 
    - message

    Information about each part is given below

    **Signature:**
    - The signature is used to verify the integrity of the message.
    - The signature is a hash of the message and is encrypted using the private key of the sender.
    - The receiver can verify the signature using the public key of the sender.

    **Header:**
    - The header contains information about various message header, refer to the header schema for more details.

    **Message:**

    - The message contains the actual payload of the message.
    - Refer example section to get sample data and also read Gitbook for details data objects
    - The receiver can decrypt the message using the private key of the "err.receiver_id.invalid"
